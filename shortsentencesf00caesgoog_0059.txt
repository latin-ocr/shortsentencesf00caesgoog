MA THEMA TJCS. being the most complete and scientific course

. of Mathematical Text-books published, ιε more extensively used

in the Schools and Educational Institutione-of the United states
than any competing series.

In its preparation two objects were kept constantly in view:
First, to furnish a. fun and complete Series of Text-books, which
should be sufficient to give the pupil a thorough and practica! busi-
nea} education ,· Second, to secure that intellectuat? culture without
which the mere acquisition of book knowledge is almost worthless.

Au the improvement· of the best modern Text-books, aa well as
many new and original methods‚ and practica! operatione not found
in other similar ποι-κε, have been incorporated into these books, and
no labor or expense has been spat-ed to give to the public a clear,
scientific, comprehensive and complete system, not incumbet-ed with
nnnecessary theoria, but combining and systematizing real improve-
ment: of a. pmctical end nsesul kind.

RoBJNSON‘S SHOR TER co URSE. In order to

meet a demand from many quartem sor a Series ot ArithmeticS,
few in number and comprehensive in character, we have pub-
lished the above course in TW 0 books, in which Oral md Writ-
ten Arithmetic is combined.

These books have met with very great popuhrity, having b'een in-
troduced into several of the largest citios in the United states. They
are unusually hendsome in get-up, and are substantially bound in
eloth.
