the conference Caesar could not keep his men from shouting‘
aloud in his own presence that Ariovistus was· coming for the
purpose of injuring him.

3. He ordered them to send MettiuS, because he spoke

my’s camp an'd report it to him.

4. On the same day Caesar pitched his camp three miles
beyond Ariovistus with the intention of bringing up his ,

supplies on the next day.
’ 5. Six thousand foot-soldierS, one of whom each of the
horsemen chose for the sake of his own safety, were in bat-

1. Caesar, having observed that the enemy kept himself
in camp, selected a suitable place for his own camp about
five hundred paces from the enemy, and there drew up a
triple line of battle.

2. Ariovistus will send seventeen thousand light· -armed
troops to drive off Caesar’ s troops and prevent them from
completing their work.

3. When Caesar inquired from the prisoners for what
⁸ reason the Germans did not offer him a chance to fight, he
found out that the reason was that they thought they could

not conquer before full moon.
4. It is not Caesar’s custom to pronounce by lots and

divination whether or not it is advantageous to engage in
battle, because he thinks that it is the will of heaven that
his own legionary soldiers shall conquer, whether it is new
moon or not.
