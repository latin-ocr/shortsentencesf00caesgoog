PREFACE. Ε 0‘4‘2·
’ l- A &ulemad-

THE first edition of “ Short Sentences ” was printed a few
years ago mainly for use in the Roxbury Latin School. Al-
though it was never published or advertised, it has neverthe·
less found its way into several other schools 3 and those
teachers who have used it speak highly of its value to them.

The present edition, much larger'than the first, carries the

work through the whole of the first book of the “ Gallie

, War,’' and has in addition nine pages of Notes. The ob·

ject of the work, I need hardly say, is to give the pupil a
considerable amount of practice in turning English into
Latin with the classic models directly before him, and recip-
rocally to aid him in the translation of the text of Caesar into
good English. It is hoped that in both directions the notes
will be found a valuable auxiliary. They are not grammati-
cal, strictly speaking, except in a few instanceS. They may Ο
rather be called idiomatical. I believe that all teachers will
acknowledge the value of this kind of help to the student
of any foreign language.

To Mr. W. C. Collar‚ Head Master of the school, Ι am
indebted for many valuable suggestions while preparing the

present work for the press,
